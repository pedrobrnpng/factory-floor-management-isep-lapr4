how to make this work

first create key

openssl genrsa -des3 -out rootCA.key 2048

then create pem

openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out rootCA.pem

you now have a key and a certificate

now go to where the server keystore is and import the certificate, also do it to cacerts because why not

now you have encrypted communications BAM

certificate pass is caspar 

when asked for it, you have to enter it twice:
	
	"caspar - ENTER - caspar - ENTER"
